An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

For example 

is_isogram("game" ) == true

is_isogram("aabb" ) == false

is_isogram("Rruby" ) == false
